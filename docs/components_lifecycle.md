# Components

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

Conceptually, components are like pure functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called `props`) and return a tree describing what should appear on the screen.

Components can also have an associated internal state which is private and fully controlled by the component.

### Creating a component class

Every component must subclass `UIComponent<UIStateProtocol, UIPropsProtocol>`.

If you desire to have a *stateless* component you can use the special `UINilState` type as generic parameter of your class.

Similarly, if your component does not require any *props*, you can use `UINilProps` as generic parameter.

```swift
class MyStatelessProplessComponent: UIComponent<UINilState, UINilProps> {...}

class MyProps: UIProps {...}
class MyStatelessComponent: UIComponent<UINilState, MyProps> {...}

class MyState: UIState {...}
class MyStatefulComponent: UIComponent<MyState, MyProps> { }

```

### Instantiating a component

Components in **Render** are always instantiated from a `UIContext`, and this is generally owned by a ViewController.

When a component is *stateless*, you can instantiate a component instance by calling `transientComponent(_:props:parent)` in `UIContext`.
Components are lightweight objects and the cost of instantiate one is totally neglectable.

```swift
let component = context.transientComponent(MyStatelessComponent.self, props: MyProps(), parent: nil)
```

If your component is *stateful* it must have a **key**, and `UIContext` works like an identity map returning the same instance for the same given key - in this case the way you can obtain an instance for your *stateful* component is by calling `component(_:key:props:parent)` in `UIContext`.

```swift
let component = context.component(MyStatefulComponent.self, key: "root", props: MyProps(), parent: nil)
```

### Mouting a root component

After you have your component instance, the next step is to installing it to your view hierarchy (typically from your ViewController).
This is done through setting the component `canvasView`.

```swift
let context = UIContext()
// Create your component instance.
let component = context.component(MyStatefulComponent.self, key: "root")
// Install the component in the view hierarchy.
component.setCanvas(view: view, options: UIComponentCanvasOption.defaults())
// Render the component.
component.setNeedsRender()
```

It is strongly recommended to use `UIComponentViewController` and `UIComponentTableViewController` as base class for your ViewControllers.
This way you do not have to worry about creating/destroying the context yourself and installing the component in the ViewController view hierarchy.

Moreover `UIComponentViewController` has built-in update on orientation change, support for safe area insets and an optional [component-based navigation bar](navigation_bar.md).

```swift
class MyViewController: UIComponentViewController<MyRootComponent> {

  override func buildRootComponent() -> MyRootComponent {
    return context.component(MyRootComponent.self, key: "root")
  }
}
```

### Component rendering

The most important method of your component class is `render(context:)`.
This should return a view hierarchy description by using nodes.

```swift
class MyStatefulComponent: UIComponent<MyState, MyProps> {
	
  override func render(context: UIContext) -> UINodeProtocol {
    let container = UINode<UIView> { spec in
      spec.configure(\.yoga.width, spec.canvasSize.width)
      spec.configure(\.yoga.heigh, spec.canvasSize.height/2)
    }
    let label = UINode<UILabel> { spec
      spec.configure(\.text, "foo")
    }
    return container.children([label])
  }
}
```

Components can be reused in a very granular fashion.

```swift
class MyLabelProps: UIProps { 
  var title: String = ""
}

class MyLabelComponent: UIStatelessComponent<MyLabelProps> {

  override func render(context: UIContext) -> UINodeProtocol {
    return UINode<UILabel> { spec in spec.configure(\.text, self.props.title) }
  }
}

class MyStatefulComponent: UIComponent<MyState, MyProps> {
	
  override func render(context: UIContext) -> UINodeProtocol {
    let container = ...
   
    let label = childComponent(MyLabelProps.self, props: MyLabelProps(title: "foo")).asNode()
    return container.children([label])
  }
}
```

`UINode<UIViewType>` is an abstraction around views of any sort that knows how to build, configure and layout the view when necessary.

Every time `setNeedsRender(options:)` is called, a new tree is constructed, compared to the existing tree and only the required changes to the actual view hierarchy are performed. Also the layout is re-computed based on the nodes' flexbox attributes. 

### [Props vs State](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/edit/master/props-vs-state.md)

> What's the exact difference between _props_ and _state_?

It's fairly easy to understand how they work—especially when seen in context—but it's also a bit difficult to grasp them conceptually. It's confusing at first because they both have abstract terms and their values look the same, but they also have very different _roles._ 

You could say _props_ + _state_ is the input data for the `render()` function of a Component, so we need to zoom in and see what each data type represents and where does it come from.

#### _props_

_props_ are a Component's **configuration,** its _options_ if you may. They are received from above and **immutable** as far as the Component receiving them is concerned.

A Component cannot change its _props,_ but it is responsible for putting together the _props_ of its child Components.

#### _state_

The _state_ starts with a default value when a Component mounts and then **suffers from mutations in time (mostly generated from user events).** It's a representation of one point in time—a snapshot.

A Component manages its own _state_ internally, but—besides setting an initial state—has no business fiddling with the _state_ of its children. You could say the state is **private.**


#### Should this Component have _state_? 

_state_ is optional. Since _state_ increases complexity and reduces predictability, a Component without _state_ is preferable. Even though you clearly can't do without state in an interactive app, you should avoid having too many _Stateful Components._

 _Recap_

* **Stateless Component** — Only _props_, no _state._ There's not much going on besides the `render()` function and all their logic revolves around the _props_ they receive. This makes them very easy to follow (and test for that matter).
* **Stateful Component** — Both _props_ and _state._ They should take care of user interaction and some of the complex business logic, while all visualization and formatting logic should move downstream into as many _Stateless Components_ as possible.

### UINode

 `UINode` is a lightweight is the smallest building block in Render.Every component returns a tree of nodes and Render infra in charge of reconciliate the changes and evert call of `setNeedsRender(options:)` .
 
#### Node configuration

The `layoutSpec` closure (set at node construction time) is executed every time the component is re-rendered.
 
```swift
let node = UINode<UILabel> { spec in 
  spec.set(\.backgroundColor, .black)
  // ...this is analogous
  spec.view.backgroundColor = .black 
  
  // Flexbox properties
  spec.set(\.yoga.width, spec.canvasWidth/2)
  spec.set(\.yoga.height, 32)
  spec.set(\.yoga.margin, 8)
} 
```

#### `spec.set()` vs `spec.view`

To configure the view you can call `spec.set()` or directly use the **view** reference by accessing `spec.view` - the former is advantageous because the view property associated to the given *keypath* is changed only if needed, while any configuration that goes through a direct access of `spec.view` is performed at any call of `setNeedsRender(options:)`.

Another advantage of `spec.set()` is that every single property can be animated by passing a `UIViewPropertyAnimator` as argument.

```swift
spec.set(\.cornerRadius, 20, UIViewPropertyAnimator(duration: 0.6, dampingRatio: 0.6, animations: nil))
```

More documentation on animations in Render can be found [here](animations.md).

#### UILayoutSpecStyle

A more convenient way of configuring your views is relying on `UILayoutSpecStyle<UIViewType>`.
This allows you to share and combine configurations as styles for your nodes.

```swift
let redSpecStyle = UILayoutSpecStyle<UIView> { spec in 
  spec.set(\.backgroundColor, .red)
}
let roundedSpecStyle = UILayoutSpecStyle<UIView> { spec in 
  spec.set(\.cornerRadius, 8)
}
let node = UINode<UIView>(styles: [redSpecStyle, roundedSpecStyle])
```

#### UINode custom creating closure

You might want to have a custom init method called on the view that is going to be built for you node, or more generally just configure your view once.
You can achieve this by passing a custom `create` closure to the node init method concurrently with a custom 
`reuseIdentifier`.

```swift
let node = UINode<UIButton>(reuseIdentifier: "roundedRectButton", 
                            create: { return UIButton(type: .roundedRect) })
```

#### `reuseIdentifier` vs `key`

Every node exposes these 2 properties and even if it could be confusing at first, their role is very different.

* **reuseIdentifier** - Mainly for performance optimization reasons only - it's a way to flag a way for optimal reuse. **Mandatory** when your node has a custom creation closure.
* **key** - Used to give the node a unique identity for state storing purposes - every child component must be constructed with a unique key. [usually used in lists.](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

### Lightweight Integration with UIKit

*Components* can be installed in any view hierarchy and any `UIView` (UIKit components or custom ones) can be wrapped in a `UINode`.


The framework doesn't force you to use the Component abstraction. You can use normal UIViews with autolayout inside a component or vice versa. 

#### Performance & Thread Model

**Render**'s `setNeedsRender(options:)` function is performed on the main thread. Diff+Reconciliation+Layout+Configuration runs usually under 16ms for a component with a complex view hierarchy on a iPhone 4S, which makes it suitable for cells implementation (with smooth scrolling).
