Render is a declarative library for building efficient UIs on iOS inspired by [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

* **Declarative:** Render uses a declarative API to define UI components. You simply describe the layout for your UI based on a set of inputs and the framework takes care of the rest (*diff* and *reconciliation* from virtual view hierarchy to the actual one under the hood).
* **Flexbox layout:** Render includes the robust and battle-tested Facebook's [Yoga](https://facebook.github.io/yoga/) as default layout engine.
* **Fine-grained recycling:** Any component such as a text or image can be recycled and reused anywhere in the UI.

From [Why React matters](http://joshaber.github.io/2015/01/30/why-react-native-matters/):

>  [The framework] lets us write our UIs as pure function of their states.
> 
>  Right now we write UIs by poking at them, manually mutating their properties when something changes, adding and removing views, etc. This is fragile and error-prone. [...]
> 
> [The framework] lets us describe our entire UI for a given state, and then it does the hard work of figuring out what needs to change. It abstracts all the fragile, error-prone code out away from us. 

### Installation

If you are using **CocoaPods**:


Add the following to your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html):

```ruby
pod 'Render'
```

If you are using **Carthage**:


Add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "alexdrone/Render" "master"    
```

Manually:

Drag `bin/Render.framework` in your project and add it as an embedded binary.


# TL;DR

**Render**'s building blocks are *Components* (described in the protocol `ComponentViewType`).
This is what a component looks like:


```swift

struct CounterState: StateType {
  let count: Int = 0
}

class CounterComponentView: ComponentView<CounterState> {

  override func render() -> NodeType {
    let circle = Node<UIView> { view, layout, size in
      view.backgroundColor = UIColor.green
      layout.alignSelf = .center
      layout.width = 128
      layout.aspectRatio = 1
    }
    let text = Node<UILabel> { view, layout, size in
      view.text = "\(state.count)"
      view.textAlignment = .center
      layout.margin = 16
    }
    let container = Node<UIView> { view, layout, _ in
      view.backgroundColor = UIColor.black
      view.onTap { [weak self] _ in
      	// When the state changes the component is automatically re-rendered.
        self?.setState { state in state.count += 1 }
      }
      layout.justifyContent = .center
    }
    return container.add(children: [avatar, text])
  }
}

```

# Components

`Node<T>` is an abstraction around views of any sort that knows how to build, configure and layout the view when necessary.

Every time `update(options:)` is called, a new tree is constructed, compared to the existing tree and only the required changes to the actual view hierarchy are performed - *if you have a static view hierarchy, you might want pass the '.preventViewHierarchyDiff' option to skip this part of the rendering* . Also the `configure` closure passed as argument is re-applied to every view defined in the `render()` method and the layout is re-computed based on the nodes' flexbox attributes. 

**Check the demo project for more examples**

Components in *Render* can be **stateless** or **stateful**.

**Stateless** components are essentialy pure functions returning a view hierarchy description from the current component properties value (*props*) 

*You can define a statelss component by simply having a function returning a node tree.*

```swift
 func PaddedLabel(text: String) -> NodeType {
    return Node<UIView>(reuseIdentifier: "PaddedLabel") { view, layout, size in
      layout.padding = 4
      view.backgroundColor = ...
      }.add(children: [
        Node<UILabel> { view, _, _ in
          view.text = text
          view.font = ...
        }
    ])
  }  
```
*Or by defining a `StatelessComponent` subclass with some properties.*

  
```swift
class PaddedLabelComponentView: StatelessComponent {
  var text: String = ""

  func render() -> NodeType {
    return Node<UIView>(reuseIdentifier: "PaddedLabel") { view, layout, size in
      layout.padding = 4
      view.backgroundColor = ...
      }.add(children: [
        Node<UILabel> { view, _, _ in
          view.text = text
          view.font = ...
        }
    ])
  }
```

*Components can be composed in hierarchies:*

```swift
class ParentComponentView: StatelessComponent {

  func render() -> NodeType {
    return Node<UIScrollView>.add(children: [
        // A pure function returning a node can be be simply added to the node desciption.
        PaddedLabel(text: "foo"),
        // While a component define as a class needs to be added as a child
        // using the ComponentNode function.
        // N.B. Stateful components need to provide a unique 'key' as well in the 
        // ComponentNode function - see the stateful components section.
        ComponentNode(PaddedLabelComponentView(), in: self) { $0.text = "foo" }
      ])
    }
  }
```

As opposed to **stateless** components, **stateful** components don't rely uniquely on *props* to render but they mantain an internal state.

### [Props vs State](https://github.com/uberVU/react-guide/edit/master/props-vs-state.md)

> What's the exact difference between _props_ and _state_?

It's fairly easy to understand how they work—especially when seen in context—but it's also a bit difficult to grasp them conceptually. It's confusing at first because they both have abstract terms and their values look the same, but they also have very different _roles._ 

You could say _props_ + _state_ is the input data for the `render()` function of a Component, so we need to zoom in and see what each data type represents and where does it come from.

#### _props_

_props_ are a Component's **configuration,** its _options_ if you may. They are received from above and **immutable** as far as the Component receiving them is concerned.

A Component cannot change its _props,_ but it is responsible for putting together the _props_ of its child Components.


#### _state_

The _state_ starts with a default value when a Component mounts and then **suffers from mutations in time (mostly generated from user events).** It's a representation of one point in time—a snapshot.

A Component manages its own _state_ internally, but—besides setting an initial state—has no business fiddling with the _state_ of its children. You could say the state is **private.**

_In Render a component can change its internal state by calling the `setState(options:change:)` function._

```swift
struct CounterState: StateType {
  let count: Int = 0
}
class CounterComponentView: ComponentView<CounterState> {

  // A property configurable from the outside.
  // The component will increment on tap if this is true, decrement otherwise.
  var shouldIncrement: Bool = true
  // Another simple property.
  var background: UIColor = UIColor.black

  override func render() -> NodeType {
    let circle = ...    
    let text = ...
    let container = Node<UIView> { view, layout, _ in
      view.backgroundColor = self.background
      view.onTap { _ in
      	// When the state changes the component is automatically re-rendered.
        self.setState { state in 
          if self.shouldIncrement {
            state.count += 1 
          } else {
            state.count -= 1
          }
      }
    }
    return container.add(children: [avatar, text])
  }
}

```

_When stateful components are added as children components it is necessary to specify a unique key for them
so that the infra will be able to store their internal states:_

```swift
class ParentComponentView: StatelessComponent {
  func render() -> NodeType {
    return Node<UIScrollView>.add(children: [
        ComponentNode(CounterComponentView(), in: self, key:"counter") { $0.text = "foo" }
      ])
    }
  }
```

#### Should this Component have _state_? 

_state_ is optional. Since _state_ increases complexity and reduces predictability, a Component without _state_ is preferable. Even though you clearly can't do without state in an interactive app, you should avoid having too many _Stateful Components._

 _Recap_

* **Stateless Component** — Only _props_, no _state._ There's not much going on besides the `render()` function and all their logic revolves around the _props_ they receive. This makes them very easy to follow (and test for that matter).
* **Stateful Component** — Both _props_ and _state._ They should take care of user interaction and some of the complex business logic, while all visualization and formatting logic should move downstream into as many _Stateless Components_ as possible.

### reuseIdentifier vs key

Every node exposes these 2 properties and even if it could be confusing at first, their role is very different.

* **reuseIdentifier** - Mainly for performance optimisation reasons only - it's a way to flag a way for optimal reuse. **Mandatory** when your node has a custom creation closure.
* **key** - Used to give the node a unique identity for state storing purposes - every child component must be constructed with a unique key. [Extremely useful in lists.](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html)


# Lightweight Integration with UIKit

*Components* are plain UIViews, so they can be used inside a vanilla view hierarchy with *autolayout* or *layoutSubviews*.
Similarly plain vanilla UIViews (UIKit components or custom ones) can be wrapped in a `Node`.


The framework doesn't force you to use the Component abstraction. You can use normal UIViews with autolayout inside a component or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest difference from Facebook's `ComponentKit`.

### Performance & Thread Model

**Render**'s `update(options:)` function is performed on the main thread. Diff+Reconciliation+Layout+Configuration runs usually under 16ms for a component with a complex view hierarchy on a iPhone 4S, which makes it suitable for cells implementation (with smooth scrolling).


### Components embedded in cells

You can wrap your components in `ComponentTableViewCell` or `ComponentCollectionViewCell` and use the classic dataSource/delegate pattern for you view controller.

### Declarative UI(Table/Collection)View implementation

You can quickly leverage the efficiency of UITableView and UICollectionView and their cell reuse capabilities by using **TableNode** or **CollectionNode** as the container node for your children.
In this way the node's subnodes will be wrapped inside `UITableViewCollectionCell` or `UICollectionNode`.

Changes in the collection results in fine grain table changes (add/remove/move cells) as long as every children node in the collection has a unique `key`.

```swift

 override func render() -> NodeType {
    let table = TableNode { _, layout, _ in
      // Size, margins and padding can also be expressed as a % of the parent.
      (layout.percent.height, layout.percent.width) = (100%, 100%)
    }
    return table.add(children: [
      // Any node definition will be wrapped inside a UITableViewCell.
      PaddedLabel(text: "foo"),
      PaddedLabel(text: "bar"),
      // ComponentViews can also be added as child-nodes.
      ComponentNode(MyComponent(), state: state.bar) { $0.props = ... }
    ])
  }

```

# Example projects

* The [_Render catalogue app_](https://github.com/alexdrone/Render/tree/master/samples) contains a number of complex components and layouts.
* [_RenderDemos_](https://github.com/alexdrone/RenderDemos) is a github repo with more complex applications built with Render.

# Inspector (Experimental)

When the app is run in the simulator it is possible to inspect Render components, their properties and state with the [inspector companion mac app](https://github.com/alexdrone/Render/raw/master/inspector/dist/render-inspector.zip).

To enable the debug server in your app you simply have to  import the  `RenderInspector` framework and  call `startRenderInspectorServer()` in your AppDelegate `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions)`.

```swift

import Render
import RenderInspector

class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    /// Starts the debug server at localhost:8080/inspect
    startRenderInspectorServer()
    ...
 }
```

#### Use with Dispatch or Reswift

* [Dispatch](https://github.com/alexdrone/Dispatch) is a Flux-like implementation of the unidirectional data flow architecture in Swift.
In this architecture views are simple function of your state - this works especially well with Render's declarative programming style.

Checkout the [TodoApp](https://github.com/alexdrone/Dispatch/tree/master/samples/TodoApp) example to see how to get the best out of **Dispatch** and **Render**.


* [ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift) is a Redux-like implementation of the unidirectional data flow architecture in Swift.
