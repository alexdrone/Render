*React-inspired Swift library for writing UIKit UIs.*
[(Swift 2.3 branch here)](https://github.com/alexdrone/Render/tree/swift_2_3)


#Why

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/alexdrone/Render](https://badges.gitter.im/alexdrone/Render.svg)](https://gitter.im/alexdrone/Render?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

From [Why React matters](http://joshaber.github.io/2015/01/30/why-react-native-matters/):

>  [The framework] lets us write our UIs as pure function of their states.
> 
>  Right now we write UIs by poking at them, manually mutating their properties when something changes, adding and removing views, etc. This is fragile and error-prone. [...]
> 
> [The framework] lets us describe our entire UI for a given state, and then it does the hard work of figuring out what needs to change. It abstracts all the fragile, error-prone code out away from us. 

## Installation

### Carthage



To install Carthage, run (using Homebrew):

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Then add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "alexdrone/Render" "master"    
```

#### Manually
1. Download and drop ```/Render``` folder in your project.  
2. Congratulations!

To get the full benefits import `Render` wherever you import UIKit

``` swift
import UIKit
import Render
```

#TL;DR

**Render**'s building blocks are *Components* (described in the protocol `ComponentViewType`).


Despite virtually any `UIView` object can be a component (as long as it conforms to the above-cited protocol),
**Render**'s core functionalities are exposed by the two main Component base classes: `ComponentView` and `StaticComponentView` (optimised for components that have a static view hierarchy).

**Render** layout engine is based on [FlexboxLayout](https://github.com/alexdrone/FlexboxLayout).

This is what a component looks like:


```swift

final class AlbumComponentView: ComponentView {

  /// The component state.
  var album: Album {
    return self.state as! Album
  }

  /// Constructs the component tree.
  override func construct() -> NodeType {
    return wrapper(isFeatured: self.featured).children([
      albumCover(isFeatured: self.featured, cover: self.album?.cover).children([
        // This node is added only when self.featured is 'true'.
        when(self.featured, defaultButton())]),
      textContainer(isFeatured: self.featured).children([
        text(title: self.album?.title ?? "None", isTitle: true),
        text(title: self.album?.artist ?? "Unknown Artist", isTitle: false)])
      ])
    }    
  }
}

fileprivate func albumCover(isFeatured: Bool, cover: UIImage?) -> Node<UIImageView> {
  return Node<UIImageView>().configure { view in
    let smallSize = AlbumComponentView.Metrics.smallSize
    let bigSize = AlbumComponentView.Metrics.bigSize
    view.image = cover
    view.layer.cornerRadius = isFeatured ? 0 : smallSize/2
    view.clipsToBounds = true
    view.useFlexbox = true
    view.layout_alignSelf = .center
    view.layout_alignItems = .center
    view.layout_justifyContent = .center
    view.layout_width = isFeatured ? bigSize : smallSize
    view.layout_height = isFeatured ? bigSize : smallSize
    view.layout_marginAll = isFeatured ? 0 : 4
  }
}

fileprivate func text(title: String, isTitle: Bool) -> Node<UILabel> {
  return Node<UILabel>().configure { view in
    view.text = title
    view.font = isTitle
    ? UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18.0, weight: UIFontWeightBold)
    : UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 12.0, weight: UIFontWeightLight)
    view.textColor = S.Color.white
    view.numberOfLines = isTitle ? 1 : 0
    view.useFlexbox = true
  }
}

fileprivate func defaultButton(title: String = "Button") -> Node<UIButton> {
  return Node<UIButton>().configure { view in
    ... Check the demo for more info
  }
}

fileprivate func wrapper(isFeatured: Bool) -> Node<UIView> {
    return Node<UIView>().configure { view in
      ... Check the demo for more info
    }
  }
}

fileprivate func textContainer(isFeatured: Bool) -> Node<UIView> {
  return Node<UIView>().configure{ view in
    ... Check the demo for more info
  }
}

...


```

The view description is defined by the `construct()` method.

`Node<T>` is an abstraction around views of any sort that knows how to build, configure and layout the view when necessary.

Every time `renderComponent()` is called, a new tree is constructed, compared to the existing tree and only the required changes to the actual view hierarchy are performed - *if you have a static view hierarchy, you might want to inherit from `StaticComponentView` to skip this part of the rendering* . Also the `configure` closure passed as argument is re-applied to every view defined in the `construct()` method and the layout is re-computed based on the nodes' flexbox attributes. 

The component above would render to:

###Lightweight Integration with UIKit

*Components* are plain UIViews, so they can be used inside a vanilla view hierarchy with *autolayout* or *layoutSubviews*.
Similarly plain vanilla UIViews (UIKit components or custom ones) can be wrapped in a `Node` (so they can be part of a `ComponentView` or a `StaticComponentView`).

The framework doesn't force you to use the Component abstraction. You can use normal UIViews with autolayout inside a component or vice versa. This is probably one of the biggest difference from Facebook's `ComponentKit`.

###Performance & Thread Model

**Render**'s `renderComponent()` function is performed on the main thread. Diff+Layout+Configuration runs usually under 16ms on a iPhone 4S, which makes it suitable for cells implementation (with a smooth scrolling).

###Live Refresh

You can use **Render** with [Injection](https://github.com/johnno1962/injectionforxcode) in order to have live refresh of your components.
Install the injection plugin, patch your project for injection and add this code inside your component class (or in your ViewController):

```swift

class MyComponentView: ComponentView {
	...
	func injected() {
		self.renderComponent()
	}
}

```

###Backend-driven UIs

Given the descriptive nature of **Render**'s components, components can be defined in JSON or XML files and downloaded on-demand.
*The ComponentDeserializer is being worked on as we speak*.


###Components embedded in cells

You can wrap your components in `ComponentTableViewCell` or `ComponentCollectionViewCell` and use the classic dataSource/delegate pattern for you view controller.
